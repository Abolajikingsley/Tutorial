# Tutorial
Hello everyone! Welcome to my first app (although still incomplete)!. I built this to organize and co-ordinate tutorial classes that are set-up by the 200level students of the faculty of engineering of the University of Lagos. It occured to me after the completion of my first year exams, and I noticed that tutorial classes were often hapharzardly organized, and due to this, a lot of students did not have access to them. Therefore, this app, when completed, would be able to accomplish the task of notifying interested students in organized tutorial classes.
Enjoy!
